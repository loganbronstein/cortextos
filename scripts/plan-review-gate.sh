# plan-review-gate.sh — Enforce the Plan-First Review rule at git push time.
#
# Invoked by scripts/hooks/pre-push BEFORE build + tests run. Looks for a
# `.claude/plan-reviews/<branch-slug>-plan.md` file containing either:
#   - a `QUORUM: PASS (N/10)` line with N >= 8 AND mandatory personas
#     (Security + DataIntegrity) present and not marked FAIL/REJECT, OR
#   - a `TRIVIAL-TASK-EXEMPT: <one-sentence reason>` line for tiny work
#     (typo, doc tweak, single-line fix). Telemetry-logged for post-hoc.
#
# Spec source: SOUL.md "Plan-First Review (Logan directive 2026-04-22, from
# Bradley Banner)" section, codified fleet-wide via PR #216. This script is
# the tool-level gate that closes the W9b follow-up (the rule was previously
# enforced by convention only).
#
# Environment overrides:
#   PLAN_REVIEW_BYPASS=true       skip the gate entirely (documented escape)
#   PLAN_REVIEW_BRANCH=<name>     override branch detection (test seam)
#   PLAN_REVIEW_DIR=<path>        override .claude/plan-reviews location
#   PLAN_REVIEW_PROTECTED_REGEX   default: ^(main|master|develop|HEAD)$
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 = PASS (gate satisfied OR skipped because branch is protected/bypassed)
#   1 = BLOCK (plan file missing, malformed, or panel verdict insufficient)
#
# macOS bash 3.2 compatible. No mapfile / readarray.

[plan-review-gate] BLOCKED: Plan-First Review file is missing.

Branch:    $BRANCH
Expected:  ${PLAN_FILE#$REPO_ROOT/}

The Plan-First Review rule (codified fleet-wide via PR #216, originally from
Bradley Banner) requires every non-trivial branch to carry a 10-persona
reviewer panel decision in the repo BEFORE the push.

Create the plan file by copying the template:
  cp .claude/plan-reviews/TEMPLATE-plan.md "${PLAN_FILE#$REPO_ROOT/}"
  # then fill in the panel verdicts and commit.

For genuinely trivial work (typo, doc tweak, 1-line config), the file may
contain a single line:
  TRIVIAL-TASK-EXEMPT: <one-sentence reason>

Override (last resort, telemetry-logged): PLAN_REVIEW_BYPASS=true git push.
Reference: SOUL.md "Plan-First Review" section.
