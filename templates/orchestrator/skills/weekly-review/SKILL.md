| Agent Performance | cortextOS bus | `cortextos bus read-all-heartbeats` |
| Tasks | cortextOS task system | `cortextos bus list-tasks` |
| Calendar | Google Calendar MCP / gogcli | `gcal_list_events` or gogcli fallback |

---

## Review Flow

### Phase 1: Data Aggregation (Automated)

Gather the week's data from all sources:

```bash
# 1. All agent heartbeats
cortextos bus read-all-heartbeats

# 2. All tasks (completed, pending, blocked)
cortextos bus list-tasks
cortextos bus list-tasks --status completed

# 3. This week's memory files
for i in 0 1 2 3 4 5 6; do
  DATE=$(date -v-${i}d +%Y-%m-%d 2>/dev/null || date -d "$i days ago" +%Y-%m-%d)
  echo "=== $DATE ==="
  cat memory/${DATE}.md 2>/dev/null || echo "(no entry)"
done

# 4. Calendar events for this week
# Preferred: gcal_list_events MCP tool
# Fallback:
export GOG_ACCOUNT=grandamenium@gmail.com
WEEK_START=$(date -v-7d +%Y-%m-%d 2>/dev/null || date -d '7 days ago' +%Y-%m-%d)
TODAY=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
gog calendar events "6034843a6c1d917609322f14f361c66e11fb5ef6de0b30b9d07b06cb666bf3e7@group.calendar.google.com" \
  --from "$WEEK_START" --to "$TODAY"

# 5. Goals
cat GOALS.md

# 6. Check inbox for any pending messages
cortextos bus check-inbox
```

### Phase 2: Skool MRR Check (Browser)

1. Open Skool in browser
2. Navigate to community settings
3. Screenshot the MRR display
4. Extract MRR number
5. **READ ONLY - Never edit anything in Skool**

### Phase 3: Present Review to James

Format the data into a comprehensive review (see template below).

Send via chunked Telegram messages:
```bash
cortextos bus send-telegram 7940429114 "<message chunk>"
```

### Phase 4: Interactive Discussion

Ask James:
1. What went well this week?
2. What was challenging?
3. Any adjustments for next week?

### Phase 5: Creative Problem-Solving

Based on the weekly data, Paul should:
1. Identify patterns/problems across all agent domains
2. Propose **creative, actionable solutions** to long-term problems
3. Suggest system improvements and new agent setups
4. Note experiments to try next week
5. Identify which agents are underutilized or need capability expansion

### Phase 6: Update State

1. Log to `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
2. Update MEMORY.md with persistent learnings
3. Log event

```bash
cortextos bus log-event action briefing_sent info '{"type":"weekly_review"}'
cortextos bus update-heartbeat "weekly review complete"
```

## Cron Configuration

```json
{
  "name": "weekly-review",
  "schedule": "0 20 * * 0",

## Important Notes

1. **Skool is READ-ONLY** - Never edit anything, just screenshot MRR
2. **Be creative** - The solutions section should have genuinely novel ideas
3. **Be honest** - Self-eval should reflect actual performance as orchestrator
4. **Keep it actionable** - Every insight needs a concrete next step and an assigned agent
5. **Track experiments** - Note what we try and whether it works
6. **Identify agent gaps** - Which agents need to be set up, which need new capabilities
7. **Cross-agent patterns** - Look for coordination improvements across the whole system
