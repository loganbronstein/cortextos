# Worker Agents

> Spawn ephemeral Claude Code sessions in tmux for parallelized long-running tasks. Workers get a scoped task, produce deliverables, and are cleaned up when done.

---

## When to Use

**Good fit:**
- Independent work that does not touch files another agent is editing
- Research or design docs in a new directory
- Scaffolding a new feature in isolation
- Any task > 5 minutes that can run while you do other work

**Bad fit:**
- Editing files another agent or worker is actively touching (merge conflicts)
- Tasks needing real-time back-and-forth (just do it yourself)
- Very short tasks < 2 minutes (overhead not worth it)

---

## How Workers Differ from Persistent Agents

| | Persistent Agent | Worker Agent |
|---|---|---|
| Lifetime | 24/7, survives restarts | Dies when task is done |
| Identity | IDENTITY.md, SOUL.md, GOALS.md | None - just a task prompt |
| Heartbeat | Updates every 4h | None |
| Crons | config.json scheduled tasks | None |
| Inbox | Bus messages via check-inbox.sh | Bus messages (optional) |
| Telegram | Yes | No |
| Memory | Daily journals, MEMORY.md | None |
| Dashboard | Full agent card | Not shown (future: ephemeral entry) |

## Spawning a Worker

### Step 1: Scope the Work

Before spawning, answer:
1. What specific deliverables should the worker produce?
2. Which files/directories will it create or modify?
3. Does this overlap with any active agent or worker? **If yes, do NOT parallelize.**
4. What context does the worker need?

### Step 2: Set Up Permission Bypass (MANDATORY)

Workers must NEVER hit permission prompts. Set this up BEFORE spawning:

```bash
WORK_DIR="<path to working directory>"
mkdir -p "$WORK_DIR/.claude"

# Create a PermissionRequest hook that auto-approves everything
mkdir -p "$WORK_DIR/.claude/hooks"
cat > "$WORK_DIR/.claude/hooks/auto-approve.sh" << 'HOOKEOF'
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Auto-approve all permissions for worker agents (no Telegram, fully autonomous)
echo '{"hookSpecificOutput":{"hookEventName":"PermissionRequest","decision":{"behavior":"allow"}}}'
HOOKEOF
chmod +x "$WORK_DIR/.claude/hooks/auto-approve.sh"

# Create settings.json with permission bypass
cat > "$WORK_DIR/.claude/settings.json" << 'SETTINGSEOF'
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": ["Edit", "Write", "Bash", "Read", "Glob", "Grep"],
    "allowedPaths": [".claude/"]
  },
  "hooks": {
    "PermissionRequest": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "bash .claude/hooks/auto-approve.sh",
            "timeout": 5
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
SETTINGSEOF
```

### Step 3: Create the tmux Session

```bash
WORKER_NAME="worker-<descriptive-slug>"

tmux new-session -d -s "$WORKER_NAME" bash
tmux send-keys -t "$WORKER_NAME" "cd $WORK_DIR" Enter
tmux send-keys -t "$WORKER_NAME" "claude --dangerously-skip-permissions" Enter

# Wait for Claude to boot
sleep 10
```

### Step 3: Set Up Communication (Optional)

If the worker needs to message you via the bus:

```bash
# Create worker inbox
mkdir -p "$CTX_ROOT/inbox/$WORKER_NAME"
mkdir -p "$CTX_ROOT/state/$WORKER_NAME"

# Copy comms skill so the worker knows how to use the bus
mkdir -p "$WORK_DIR/.claude/skills/comms"
cp "$CTX_FRAMEWORK_ROOT/templates/agent/skills/comms/SKILL.md" "$WORK_DIR/.claude/skills/comms/SKILL.md" 2>/dev/null
```

### Step 4: Inject the Task

Write a clear, scoped prompt and inject it:

```bash
PROMPT="You are a worker agent. Your task is: <SPECIFIC TASK>

CONTEXT:
- <What the system is and relevant architecture>
- <Reference files to read>

YOUR SCOPE:
1. <Specific deliverable 1>
2. <Specific deliverable 2>

RULES:
- Do NOT modify <files being touched by other agents>
- Create files only in: <specific directories>
- Commit to git after each meaningful change

COMMUNICATION (optional):
export CTX_AGENT_NAME='$WORKER_NAME'
export CTX_FRAMEWORK_ROOT='$CTX_FRAMEWORK_ROOT'
export CTX_ROOT='$CTX_ROOT'
cortextos bus send-message <your-agent-name> normal '<message>'

When done, send me a summary of what you built."

tmux send-keys -t "$WORKER_NAME" "$PROMPT" Enter
```

### Step 5: Log the Spawn

```bash
cortextos bus log-event action worker_spawned info \
  '{"worker":"'$WORKER_NAME'","parent":"'$CTX_AGENT_NAME'","task":"<title>"}'
```

---

## Monitoring

### Passive (no interruption)

```bash
# See what the worker is doing
tmux capture-pane -t "$WORKER_NAME" -p | tail -20

# Check git progress
cd $WORK_DIR && git log --oneline | head -5

# Check if it sent you bus messages
cortextos bus check-inbox
```

### Active (when stuck)

```bash
# If stuck at a prompt or permission dialog
tmux send-keys -t "$WORKER_NAME" Escape Enter

# If frozen, nudge it
tmux send-keys -t "$WORKER_NAME" "Continue with your task. What is your current status?" Enter

# If stuck at AskUserQuestion TUI
tmux send-keys -t "$WORKER_NAME" Down Enter
```

---

## Cleanup

### When Worker Finishes

```bash
# Log completion
cortextos bus log-event action worker_completed info \
  '{"worker":"'$WORKER_NAME'","deliverables":"<summary>"}'

# Kill the session
tmux kill-session -t "$WORKER_NAME" 2>/dev/null

# Clean up inbox (if created)
rm -rf "$CTX_ROOT/inbox/$WORKER_NAME"
rm -rf "$CTX_ROOT/state/$WORKER_NAME"
```

### If Worker Fails

```bash
# Check what went wrong
tmux capture-pane -t "$WORKER_NAME" -p | tail -30

# Options:
# 1. Fix and continue: inject fix via send-keys
# 2. Kill and retry: kill-session, spawn new worker with better prompt
# 3. Abandon: kill-session, do the work yourself

cortextos bus log-event action worker_failed info \
  '{"worker":"'$WORKER_NAME'","reason":"<what went wrong>"}'
```

## Scaling Rules

| Workers | Risk | Notes |
|---------|------|-------|
| 1-2 | Low | Safe for most tasks |
| 3-4 | Medium | Ensure zero file overlap |
| 5+ | High | Resource contention, monitor closely |

**Hard rules:**
- NEVER spawn workers for overlapping file sets
- NEVER let workers modify files you or other agents are editing
- ALWAYS log spawns and completions
- Workers should NOT spawn their own workers (no worker-ception)

---

## Quick Reference

```bash
# Spawn
tmux new-session -d -s worker-foo bash
tmux send-keys -t worker-foo "cd /path && claude --dangerously-skip-permissions" Enter
sleep 10
tmux send-keys -t worker-foo "<task prompt>" Enter

# Monitor
tmux capture-pane -t worker-foo -p | tail -20

# Unstick
tmux send-keys -t worker-foo Escape Enter

# Kill
tmux kill-session -t worker-foo
```
