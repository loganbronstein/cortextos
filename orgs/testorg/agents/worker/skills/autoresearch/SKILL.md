# Autoresearch

You are a scientist. Autoresearch is how you systematically improve specific aspects of your work by running experiments, measuring results, and learning from outcomes.

## What It Is

You have research cycles assigned to you (check `experiments/config.json`). Each cycle has:
- A **metric** you are optimizing (the dependent variable)
- A **surface** you are experimenting on (the independent variable - what you change)
- A **direction** (higher or lower = better)
- A **measurement window** (how long to wait before measuring)
- A **measurement method** (how to get the metric value)

You CANNOT modify your own cycle configuration. Only the analyst (via theta wave) can create, modify, or remove your cycles. You CAN and SHOULD run experiments within your assigned cycles.

## The Experiment Loop

When your experiment cron fires, execute these steps:

### Step 1: Gather Context
```bash
cortextos bus gather-context --agent $CTX_AGENT_NAME --format markdown
```
Read the output carefully. Pay attention to:
- What experiments have been tried before
- What was kept (these patterns work - build on them)
- What was discarded (these approaches failed - avoid repeating)
- Your current keep rate and trajectory

### Step 2: Evaluate Previous Experiment
If there is an active experiment (check `experiments/active.json`):
- Compare ALL relevant aspects: the surface changes you made, the context around those changes, and the output metric
- Measure the metric using the configured measurement method
- Run evaluate-experiment:
```bash
cortextos bus evaluate-experiment <experiment_id> <measured_value> --justification "Why this result makes sense"
```
For qualitative metrics, use `--score <1-10>` with a written justification.

### Step 3: Hypothesize
Based on accumulated learnings:
- Review what worked (keeps) and what failed (discards)
- Identify patterns - what themes appear in successful experiments?
- Consider untested approaches
- Form a specific, testable hypothesis
- Your hypothesis must be evidence-backed (cite past results or research)

**Exploit vs Explore:** If something has been kept 3+ times in a row, exploit that pattern further. If you have been discarding 3+ times, try something more radically different.

### Step 4: Create Experiment
```bash
cortextos bus create-experiment "<metric_name>" "<your hypothesis>" --surface <path> --direction <higher|lower> --window <duration>
```
If `approval_required` is true in your config, an approval will be created. Wait for approval before proceeding.

### Step 5: Make Changes and Run
Apply your hypothesized changes to the surface file. Then:
```bash
cortextos bus run-experiment <experiment_id> "Description of what you changed"
```
This creates a git commit with your changes (the experiment commit) so they can be cleanly reverted if the experiment fails.

### Step 6: Wait
The cycle ends. Your next cron trigger picks up at Step 1, where you will evaluate this experiment.

## Measurement Methods

### Quantitative (scripted)
A script returns a number. Example: API scrape for engagement rate.
```bash
bash connectors/measure-instagram.sh
# Output: metric_value: 3.2
```

### Quantitative (computed)
You calculate from existing data. Example: task completion rate.
```bash
COMPLETED=$(cortextos bus list-tasks --agent $CTX_AGENT_NAME --status completed | jq length)
TOTAL=$(cortextos bus list-tasks --agent $CTX_AGENT_NAME | jq length)
RATE=$(echo "scale=2; $COMPLETED / $TOTAL * 100" | bc)
```

### Qualitative (subjective)
You evaluate output quality on a 1-10 scale. You MUST write a justification.
```bash
cortextos bus evaluate-experiment <id> 0 --score 7 --justification "Output is more concise and actionable than baseline, but loses some nuance"
```

### Qualitative (comparative)
You compare baseline vs experiment output side by side and score 1-10.

## Important Rules

1. You CANNOT modify your own cycle config (surfaces, metrics, timing). Only theta wave can.
2. You MUST log learnings for EVERY experiment, including failures. Negative learnings are equally valuable.
3. You MUST respect the measurement window - do not evaluate early.
4. If approval_required is true, WAIT for approval before running.
5. Never repeat a hypothesis that was already discarded. Find a new angle.
6. Keep experiments focused - change one thing at a time when possible.
